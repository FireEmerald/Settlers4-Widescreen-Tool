## FAQ / READ ME

- Q: If you fight as mayan the music stops to play after a fight.
> A: This is a known bug, it was never fixed. You can start the music again, if you move ingame the **Sound FX** slider under *Settings* > *Sound settings*.

- Q: The Game doesn't start in a virtual machine. (*Software/Hardware 3D : Error initializing Graphic Interface !*)
> A: There are a couple of threads where people write about this problem, but none of them found a way to start the game... me too.

- Q: *Fatal error: Exception 0xc0000005 at 0x00468bd0!*
> A: Occures if something went wrong while using trading routes via ship (but not limited to this). It's a bug from the game itself.
